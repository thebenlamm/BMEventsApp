    "description": "The Temple of the Deep is a sanctuary for grief, love, and introspection, formed beneath a massive black stone that appears to hover above participants. This dark, fractured element symbolizes the weight of loss and the strength found in healing, inspired by kintsugi, where brokenness is embraced and honored. Seven narrow entrances guide visitors through the journey of mourning, leading to a central gathering space mirroring BRC's layout. Alcoves and chapels offer solitude and remembrance, while the seamless integration with the desert transforms sorrow into connection, grounding participants in shared reflection.",

One for compliments. Together, they offer the full spectrum of what it means to be human.\n\nThe Complaint Box is a place to release what feels heavy—quiet truths, uncomfortable thoughts, the parts of us we usually keep hidden. It’s not about negativity. It’s about honesty. About letting the shadow breathe.\n\nThe Compliment Box is for the soft things we notice but rarely say—moments of beauty, small joys, gentle recognitions. It’s a way of splashing whispers of light into the world, with no need for a recipient. Just a raised frequency.\n\nEach day on playa, a single anonymous submission from each box is shared on two nearby chalk boards—one from the shadow, one from the light. The pairing becomes a mirror. A soft echo. An invitation to see yourself in someone else’s words.\n\nThis isn’t about fixing.\nIt’s about feeling—together, in public.\nBecause honesty takes courage.\nEven—especially—when no one knows it’s you.\n\nIt takes bravery to put something real into a shared space—\nto let your truth exist where others might read it,\nfeel it,\nrecognize themselves in it.\n\nThis is a space for that kind of openness.\nNot performance.\nNot perfection.\nJust truth, offered bravely.",

Their escape pod crash-lands on this forsaken land—a moon of an unknown planet. They are thrown to the back of the pod against the locked hatch doors. The pod hull is perforated by numerous gamma-radiating shards, making its atmosphere increasingly toxic, as the pod AI companion's worried PSAs keep warning them. Their only path is forward, through the pod's cupola and outside. If they succeed, their only chance to survive is to brave the desolate playa and its strange inhabitants.",

An opportunity for spiritual evolution from outdated habits, shedding outgrown skins in cycles of death and renewal, and finding an inner anchor amidst any storm. It is critical to remain grounded as change is challenging, yet essential for shift and growth. Snakes are keen, cunning, yet ruthless when provoked, and act as divine messengers and guardians of sacred places. They are revered for their charm, intelligence, perception, and healing abilities and intuition. No matter how intense the storm, or constricted we feel, the grip will release, the spirals will lose momentum and eventually still. The wisdom is in the eye of your storm. Trust the ride, listen for the lessons, and harmony and peace will find you.",

    "description": "The Midnight Museum is a love letter to Burning Man art and artists. The piece is a collection of 155 faux stained glass panels depicting images of canonical pieces from past Burning Man events. The panels are presented in 31 pentagonal lanterns that are in turn arranged in rings of concentric pentagons. The project is also an assertion that the tradition of Burning Man art is an interesting and bold artistic movement in its own right; something that should be taken as seriously by critics and art historians as the notable art movements of the 20th century.",

By presenting an entrance with no true destination, it questions the nature of expectation and immediacy. Not every hidden space holds a secret, and not every thrill waits behind a closed door. We also wanted to share a bit more new context at our project. Evgenii is a European science-based artist with a strong academic background, and together we're aiming to bring a rare example of contemporary interactive art rooted in the European school — something that's almost absent at Burning Man and rarely seen in the U.S. outside of New York.\r\n\r\nOur installation will feature layered interaction scenarios involving sensors, embedded systems, and responsive behaviors. The piece is designed to engage participants on multiple sensory and emotional levels, and we believe it will bring something truly new and exciting to the playa experience.",

Inside, yarn and resin elements create a textured, immersive interior. As visitors express themselves audibly, light pulses in response, projecting into the sky. Inspired by grief and cosmic connection, the installation transforms personal emotions into a shared, luminous experience, symbolizing the echoes of human expression reaching beyond the physical realm.",

Towering 20 feet high, forged from bamboo and wind, she is a kinetic force of nature—striding across the desert like she owns it.\r\n\r\nInspired by Theo Jansen’s Strandbeests but reborn in the Playa dust as something wilder.  Something stronger.  Something louder.  Taziii fuses raw mechanical power with elemental grace.\r\nHer every step activates hidden MIDI pressure sensors, triggering immersive light and soundscapes created by the legendary Bert manymanyhaha. As wind turns to motion and motion becomes music, Taziii transforms art into entity—a desert-born biomech with something to say.\r\n\r\nShe doesn’t crawl. She conquers.\r\nShe doesn’t entertain. She commands.\r\nShe is not art. She is the future of motion.\r\n\r\nKneel before Taziii.",

Some ribs will have Plexi glass to add colors to reflect. Silk fabric on the skirt add visual flow and movement. The cantilevered heart with strings appears as if floating and moving. \r\n\r\nAt night, the Ballerina will be surrounded by solar firefly lights portraying dancing in a twinkle garden in the middle of la playa. The heart LED colors mimics fire & serves as a focal point for wondering souls in the playa at night.",

Silhouette symbols cut into the sides will allow a variety of lights to come through.  Four independent 8-10' tall structures will circle the main sculpture. These four structures will have wind instruments that both the Playa wind and participants will play.\n\nAbout once an hour after sunset, lights will travel from the base to the falcon's torso and then out to each of the 12 wings. This is the symbolic collective awaking of the transmitter for the Universal Lantern project.",

Five concentric rings, up to 20ft in diameter, chaotically spin around a central spherical infinity mirror resembling a black hole, which is held perfectly still by a beautiful trick of mathematics. Beneath the rings, is a partially enclosed space surrounded by shimmering walls of light - a space to reflect, a space to wonder, or a space to dance. The entire sculpture is also audio reactive: when it hears a nearby musical presence like an art car, it converts into a cosmological dance floor that pulses to the beat!",

There is a hole in the side that you crawl through to find a cushy space to chill in a raccoon's home. We invite participants to live like raccoons for a few moments and experience what their lives may be like inside a dumpster. Many connections will be made as participants marvel at the portal (infinity mirror) and cuddle with the trash pillows. We welcome all woodland and trashy creatures (but leave no trace)!",

Often interpreted as romantic love, it also means self love, community connection, and finding harmony within oneself. The Lovers (T4T) is about trans love, community support,  celebrating trans beauty and joy in a world that tries to erase it. This art is a message of belonging on open playa, and a love letter to queer and trans burners to feel seen and represented.",

Whether thinking of the COVID pandemic or the war in Ukraine (which began in 2014), acknowledging threats is the first step in transforming them. Although the cloud warns of instability, it also offers a gathering point where we can find camaraderie, and hope—reminding us that, together, we can adapt, resist, and shape a better future.",

A ridable central metal carp, crafted from recycled materials, appears to leap through a symbolic dragon gate, contrasting with static meditation seating. Smaller, dynamic metal fish arrange themselves across the playa, evoking a Suzhou garden pond. The artwork juxtaposes harsh desert with an implied tranquil aquatic oasis, organic life with recycled metal forms. Light, sound, and the arrangement of objects create a sense of unseen water, shifting the viewer's focus from the tangible to the felt, the internal. It argues that inner reflection and transcendence are the unifying threads connecting all moments and individuals.",

    "description": "As you walk from the city deep into the playa, these objects slowly come into view, rising from the desert. Lost. Incomplete. A series of giant children's toys...the closer you get, the smaller you feel. Everything looms large, as if you were shrinking, or it, growing. \r\n\r\nAs you draw near, the worn, weathered features and faded primary colors become clear. Past the giant children's blocks spelling \"LOVE\"  a monumental stack of four alphabet blocks invite you to climb and play. And then...old metal jax lay scattered, piled high. A giant yo-yo buried in the dust. And finally facing east towards the rising sun, a 24' tall mounted, faceless wooden soldier stands guard, its reins a swing, welcoming you to ride with him. \r\n\r\nWelcome to One Tin Soldier…",

It sits underneath an eight-sided pagoda, with each side measuring ten feet. Alternating sides are open, and benches adorned with CNC'd decorative additions will face the ball so that twine ball enthusiasts will sit and enjoy its sheer immensity whilst pondering, \"Where did they get all that twine?\" This project is based on a song by Weird Al, \"The Biggest ball of Twine in Minnesota,\" and in memory of our friend and former Manager of DPW Yellow Bikes, Andrej Kucher.",

    "description": "Echo of Emergence invites viewers into a moment of anticipation and reflection. This sculpture, a striking butterfly poised on the edge of transformation, serves as a gentle reminder that true emergence cannot be rushed. Crafted from wood, steel, mirrored acrylic, and reclaimed vinyl records, it reflects both the journey of metamorphosis and the patience it requires. The use of vinyl records gives new life to reclaimed materials, symbolizing transformation and renewal. As a prelude to Wings of Resonance, this piece stands as a testament to the beauty of timing and intention, echoing the promise of what is yet to come.",

The kaleidoscope will be made of metal, glass and mirror and LED which will be connected to a live feed HD camera projecting the imagery into the pyramid via the LED panels. Imagine interacting with a kaleidoscope but instead of looking through a small eye piece, the eye piece is a 7 foot tall pyramid.",

A subtle audio component delivers welcoming phrases in various languages, emanating discreetly from behind each mask. Referencing the Greek deity known for transformation, Proteus examines identity as mutable rather than fixed, inviting participants to consider the permeable boundaries between self and other. The installation offers a meditative counterpoint to the sensory intensity of Black Rock City.",

To climb it is to leave the familiar behind, to feel the ground slip away as the horizon redraws itself with each step.

I hope to have the participants reflect on past positive, warm, and fuzzy memories. Simple but fun and interactive.",

The outer skin plays with shadow and moiré interference patterns while the inner core is wrapped in a stained glass-like skin. As one moves inward, a third layer of the color story reveals itself along the inner surface of the structure. It's a play between the muscularity of the framing and the delicate dancing radiance of this inner sanctuary. \n\nLike the humble snail, we search for ways to carry our sanctuary with us. The spiraling shell shows how we too can transform our barriers into windows of beauty. We're reminded that even our hardest shells can become translucent, letting others' light in while sharing our own glow.",

It's meant to portray a bizarre machine from an unknown time period with an unknown function, and also evoke whimsy and absurdity. \r\n\r\nIn an alternate history, when oil was first being extracted, the explosive gases that pooled above it were seen as a liability. I'm interested in a timeline where these gases were deemed too dangerous to be useful. As such, they were burned off at the extraction site. Over time, bored roughnecks in the field began to build devices to harness this wasted potential. Spinning noisemakers and whistling tubes developed as different sites competed to make the most interesting use of this burning fuel. Eventually artists got involved and an aesthetic developed named propanepunk.",

Three arms represent facets of human striving: will (weapon), understanding (knowledge), and exploration (lantern). These are expressions of the self shaping reality through action, thought, and intuition. Yet the two legs ground the figure in duality — yin and yang, light and shadow, life and death. The insect-like form hints at a post-human archetype, a being not choosing between opposites but holding them both at once. It invites reflection on the paradox of unity through contradiction.",

Through touch, scent, light, sound, and performance, it transforms literal ass worship into sacred ritual. Modeled after Japanese Shinto architecture and adorned with church prayer candles, the shrine blends spiritual aesthetics from East and West into a playful site of irreverent reverence.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of this fusion is its centerpiece: a molded cast of the artist’s own ass, enshrined as a sacred and satirical icon. Daily meditation sessions are held at the shrine and open to all, inviting participants into moments of peace and release.\r\n\r\nMore than a feel-good “love yourself” moment, The Asscent asks participants to shed the weight of self-hatred and laugh while doing it. It’s a celebration of the body, of femininity, and of the cosmic joke of shame itself.",

The Fleur-de-lis or Lilly flower is also the three fold flame design that we see on Royal Fabric belonging to the King/Queen Archetype, that characteristic within ourselves that is self empowered.\r\n\r\nThere is a central seed pod seating area as well as cushions in each petal. Recordings of Maraya leading meditations play softly from a small sound system within the seed pod seat. The space within the petals provides a respite from the harsh Burning Man environment for participants to connect with one another and go within their own hearts and minds.\r\n\r\nThere will be subtle lighting at night illuminating the white (for purity and balance) petals in slowly cycing hues of blue (for willpower), to pink (for compassion), to gold (for wisdom) to create a serene, meditative and transformative atmosphere. These are the same colors as the sunset and sunrise, completion and new beginnings. The oscillating serpent nature of our kundalini moving forward.

    "description": "Puzzling Evidence is a striking and thought-provoking art installation designed to express a powerful journey through grief, resilience, and finding beauty in life's unexpected chaos. At its heart is an ordinary kitchen table, transformed into an extraordinary symbol of life reshaped by profound loss. Covered entirely in countless mismatched puzzle pieces, arranged randomly, the piece visually encapsulates the complex and often messy nature of piecing life back together after tragedy.\r\n \r\nIn 2015, the loss of my husband at just 50 years old, followed closely by my mother's passing the next year, left me facing a world that was suddenly unfamiliar and fragmented. Each puzzle piece, sourced from diverse puzzles never intended to align, embodies distinct memories, unexpected challenges, and critical decisions made while navigating the path of healing and rebuilding. Though intentionally mismatched, together the puzzle pieces coalesce into a cohesive, beautiful whole—illustrating that life's imperfections and fractures don't diminish its inherent beauty. Instead, these flaws amplify our uniqueness and resilience, capturing the profound truth that we are beautifully broken, perfectly imperfect, and extraordinary precisely because of our flaws.\r\n \r\nAdding an interactive dimension to the installation, the table includes subtle LED lighting controlled by an ARM processor connected to radar and microphone sensors beneath its surface. Encircled by chairs adapted for Burning Man's playa environment, the installation \"feels\" joy when people gather nearby, glowing in warm colors, and conveys sadness through cooler hues when isolated. This responsive feature highlights the importance of connection and companionship on the journey toward healing and resilience.\r\n \r\nUltimately, Puzzling Evidence invites contemplation and self-reflection, encouraging viewers to embrace their own life's puzzle—complete with gaps, mismatches, and unplanned pieces—and see it as unique and beautiful.",

    "description": "Mona DIE! DIE! DIE! is rolling into Burning Man 2025, bringing whimsical wonder and a pinch of chaos! Marking the third chapter in the Mona saga after 2023's pink Mona Bunny and 2024's Mona Mushroom, this year's 27-foot wooden sculpture of a dice boldly steps onto the tightrope between destiny and random chance, and explores the big, mysterious question: what does tomorrow hold? A meditation on death, the adventure will culminate in the Mona Funeral March featuring poetry and eulogies, while enchanting projector lights transform the giant die into Mona's fantastical visions. As grand finale, the giant wooden die will be ceremoniously cast and burned simultaneously, symbolizing our collective surrender to uncertainty and life's impermanence.",

The saying on it's chest says \"Love Your Mother\" with a large world globe serving as an obvious double entendre. The artists believe in taking care of our one and only planet, and believe that all people are one race and that we are all in this together. The watch on the dog's collar is set at 11:11, a time of oneness, and a time to send positive energy into the world. The circles stand for community, love, and the reciprocity of life. The mirrors encourage us to self-reflect and that we all shine.",

The fabric is loose in the middle, so it moves with the wind—fluttering like soft wings or petals in the air. Depending on the wind, this organic structure will create a closed cocoon-like shelter/housing for people or create an open environment where people can enter freely in and out. The panels create an open, layered space that feels calm, light, and alive—feeling the nature in harmony in sync with the motion of people, wind, and dust.\r\n\r\nThe name Cocoon reflects a moment of change—not hidden away, but resting before what comes next. The shape feels like a creature mid-transformation, wrapping around itself without closing off. It’s not a tight cocoon, but one that breathes—open to the sky, the light, and the people who enter.\r\n\r\nInside, there’s a wooden platform with hammocks and low seating. Visitors can lie down, relax, or gather quietly. \r\n\r\nCocoon is a place to pause. It’s where stillness meets motion, and where we can feel held, even in the open. Structurally static structure coming to life and transforming into an organic being, providing us a glimpse into the serenity and sublime of being alive.",

You can't see, feel, hear, touch or taste it, but you know it's there. We all have an aura, there's no choice about that. What we do have choice over is the kind of light we transmit to the world. So it is with the Lit Saguaro, a collaboration between welder and ceramicist. It relies on its metal skeleton to hold it aloft, and is at once both sturdy and fragile. It lights the desert night, inspiring Burners to turn up and tune up their light within. May it inspire you to burn bright and long.",

It shows how life, memories, and dreams are all connected like a web.\r\n\r\nWe invite everyone to come, sit around it, and take a quiet moment. We meditate, think about our loved ones, feel the peaceful energy. Vortex is also a special place for ceremonies and traditions, where people come together to celebrate new beginnings. It is a place for healing, remembering, and feeling connected to each other and to nature.",

    "description": "Hand of Fate is a striking 15-foot-tall kinetic sculpture by artist Andrey Sledkov, depicting a futuristic puppet-master's hand suspended mid-gesture. Crafted from steel and polycarbonate with textured, sculpted surfaces, it merges industrial presence with surreal elegance. Ropes hang from the fingers, transforming the sculpture into a poetic symbol of tension between control and liberation. Subtle lighting enhances its silhouette by night, while its scale and motion evoke awe and introspection. Fusing contemporary sculpture, technology, and interactive design, Hand of Fate offers a bold and thought-provoking presence on the playa.",

The heart glows and pulses in real time, visually syncing with the rhythms of those engaged. As more people connect, the lights intensify and evolve, creating a living display of collective energy.

Chromosomatic is a portrait built from genetic connections. The artist describes the sculpture as, \"a conversation, a way of talking about my DNA research in the language of art.\"",

Each letter, crafted from different materials, doubles in size until you find yourself at a tall, climbable E. The word is ITERATE. Named after the Tao Te Ching, participants experience exponential growth. It invites a long-term perspective: What happens when you embrace the vulnerability of imperfection and take a first step? What emerges when you commit to compounding effort day after day, year after year? Participants are invited to climb the E, reflect on an aspiration, and imagine where it might lead after a year, decade, century, or millennium.",

    "description": "Our first art installation at BM 2023 was the \"Tear Drop\", an interactive kinetic art sculpture. The one Teardrop in the middle, drops and creates waves; One single tear in a vast ocean of choices, potential, and repercussions.\n\nWhich leads us to the 2024 insallation, the \"Ocean of Tears\". As the ripples become waves in a vast ocean, we can sometimes find ourselves on tumultuous  waters.\nIn 2025 we will be bringing our new and improved version\n\nPeople can turn the crank in both directions, to discover how their motions will impact the wave going back and forth through eternity. Regardless of the direction and path they choose, they will always create cause and effect.",

Polished surfaces mirror the shifting environment, making the sculpture visually interactive as it changes with light, weather, and movement. The kudu becomes both subject and surface, embodying the idea that identity forms through surrounding influences. As reflections play across its body, the piece blurs the line between object and environment, stillness and motion.",

We wanted to show what it looks if we made a blown-up version of of the prison we're carrying around in our pocket. As the new generation, we're growing up inside of this so it's even harder to escape. As a performance art piece, we will dress as little Black Rock Rangers, and when we catch people on their phones, we put them in the cell. We hope it makes people laugh, then think about how we can break free from the constraints of the internet and see the world.",

Together, they form a tangible manifestation of a threshold in space-time, where the boundaries between time, light, and existence begin to blur, yet the form remains sharply, almost impossibly, clear.

Part oracle, part glitch in the myth of control, it blurs the line between prophecy and programming. The future is being coded in real time—are you the author, or just another line of script?",

The bamboo skeleton and silk pages collide with the wind, and the breath of nature and the tremor of the machine are intertwined. The fragments of the sculpture invite the audience to gaze at the flow of textual energy, but do not provide answers. It uses the breath of wind to fight against the absolute rationality of the digital age. In the interplay of bamboo and silk, it asks how humans can rebuild the poetry of existence between the cracks of reality and illusion.",

It displays a chandelier constructed from metal washers, each one catching and refracting light in ways that evoke the entrancing quality of a campfire's glow. This fascination with light's reflection off metal creates an experience reminiscent of staring endlessly into flames—alluring, yet deeply meditative. The piece encourages burners to stand around it, inviting them to leave behind digital distractions and rediscover the organic wonder of light and metal. The installation is both a homage to the primal allure of fire and a reminder of beauty found in simplicity amidst our technologically driven world.",

Consisting of two friends and two strangers, the Poppin' Off Squad encountered several challenges along the way. They got to know each other intimately, spending several days together in close confines, sharing a single room at night. Poppin' Off is a physical and metaphysical tribute to their journey, and the power of overcoming obstacles to achieve a shared goal. We offer this piece as a celebration of our community and the lengths we go to in order to participate in it. We hope your burn is poppin' off!",

Flight of the Flutterbye challenges the viewer to consider living life to its fullest, living in the moment before we say goodbye to this life. The vibrant butterfly contrasting against the monochromatic moth is a representation of the duality that exists between life and death, or the color that comes with a rainbow after a storm; these things can't exist without one another.  Live like it's tomorrow, today.",
